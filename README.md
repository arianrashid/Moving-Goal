# Moving-Goal
A minimal 2D arcade-style penalty shootout game developed in C++ using the raylib graphics library.

The player controls a single football shot and must time it perfectly to score against a horizontally moving goalpost. If the ball fully crosses the goal line between the posts, a goal is awarded. Miss, and the ball resets for another attempt.
